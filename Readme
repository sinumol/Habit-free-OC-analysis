# Habit-free-OC_Analysis_APJCP

## Overview
This repository contains bioinformatics workflows used for TCGA habit-free oral cancer data analysis for the publication "Genomic landscape of oral squamous cell carcinoma in never smokers and never drinker" The project focuses on molecular subtyping, RNA sequencing, and somatic variant calling, with an emphasis on reproducibility and security. The analyses are designed to support translational research and publication in the *Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention (APJCP)*.
TCGA processed datset and NCBI RAW datset was used for the analysis.

##WES data Analysis steps for the replication study
Quality control (FastQC)
Alignment (BWA-MEM, GRCh38)
Somatic variant calling (GATK Mutect2, Tumor only with PoN)
Variant annotation (ANNOVAR )
Downstream analyses (TMB, COSMIC signatures, Survival analysis)

###RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline
Normalization and differential expression (DESeq2)
Functional enrichment (GO, GSEA, pathway analysis)
Visualization (PCA, heatmaps, volcano plots)

## Objectives
- Perform **molecular subtyping** of oral cancer samples using transcriptomic data.
- Conduct **RNA-seq analysis** for differential expression and pathway enrichment.
- Implement **somatic variant calling pipelines** (Mutect2) for mutation profiling.
- Integrate results into multi-omic frameworks for biomarker discovery.
- Ensure **data security and compliance** through documented practices.
